# dotfiles

Simple collection of config files.

## Usage

Clone this repository and use the two scripts to manage the real desktop ones.

Usually this is done by symlinking, but this works as these are usually one-time setups.

- `sync-to-desktop.sh` -> Push configs into the desktop configs.
- `sync-to-repo.sh` -> Update configs into this repo. Use it to pull changes here after making config changes in-place (E.g. If `~/.config/zed/settings.json` was changed, pull it back here).
